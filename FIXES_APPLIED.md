## 📝 NEW STORY INTRO TEXT

Now in Section 2, after the pitch cards:

> The year is 2323. For 300 years, Epsilon Star Strategies has implemented simulation engagement for all citizens of colonized space. Requirements include a minimum of three compression tours within the Epsilon simulation systems.
>
> Training starts at age 13 standard. Evaluations are administered following each session. One full year of submersion is equivalent to 80 years of lived experience.
>
> It is well understood that with the advent of extreme technological capabilities comes a responsibility for proficient self-regulation. Otherwise, entire planets can be lost.
>
> **Training requirements are unavoidable. All citizens must comply.**

- ✅ The organization (Epsilon Star Strategies)
- ✅ The requirement (3 compression tours minimum)
- ✅ The age (starts at 13)
- ✅ The stakes (planets can be lost)
- ✅ The tone (unavoidable compliance)

### Removed Confusion
- ❌ Prison section removed (didn't fit the structured rehabilitation concept)

### Better Visual Balance

- ✅ Header no longer overlaps

## 📹 VIDEO TROUBLESHOOTING

If video still doesn't show:
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify file path: `videos/hero-background.mp4`
3. Try different browser
4. Check if video file is corrupted

Video should autoplay, loop, and be muted (required for autoplay).
