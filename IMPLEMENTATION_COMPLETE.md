## 💡 CUSTOMIZATION EXAMPLES

### Want Brighter Cyan?
```css
/* In style.css */
--accent-cyan: #00ffff;
```

### Want More Stars?
```javascript
// In script.js, line 29
const starCount = window.innerWidth < 768 ? 300 : 600;
```

### Want Slower Animations?
```css
/* In style.css */
transition: opacity 1.2s ease, transform 1.2s ease;
```

See `CUSTOMIZATION_GUIDE.md` for 50+ more tweaks.

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues
- **Videos not playing?** Check filenames (case-sensitive)

Full troubleshooting in `README.md` and `CUSTOMIZATION_GUIDE.md`.
