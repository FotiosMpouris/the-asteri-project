            <p class="preview-subtitle">The Epsilon Eridani System, 2323</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="book-preview-content">
            <div class="book-page">
              <p class="book-text">In the shadowed expanse of the Epsilon Eridani system, where the red dwarf star cast a perpetual crimson haze over the void, the starship <em>Aether's Veil</em> hung like a dormant neuron in the vast neural web of human expansion. It was the year 2323 by the old Terran calendar, though time meant little in the compressed folds of simulated existence.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">For three centuries, Epsilon Star Strategies had woven the fabric of interstellar society with threads of enforced enlightenment. Every citizen of the colonized worlds—from the teeming arcologies of New Eden to the frontier outposts on Proxima's rim—was mandated to undergo simulation tours. Three at minimum, starting at age thirteen standard. One year submerged in the pod's neural embrace equated to eighty lived years: lifetimes distilled into digital crucibles, where the raw ore of human impulse was refined into the steel of self-regulation.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">The Company preached it as a sacred duty. With technologies that could shatter planets or rewrite genomes on a whim, unchecked egos were extinction events waiting to happen. Hotheads with warp drives? Maniacs at the helm of quantum forges? Unthinkable. So they plugged in, generation after generation, emerging wiser, calmer—ready to navigate the fragile web of galactic trade, diplomacy, and the occasional shadow war.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">But not all emerged unscathed. Some minds fractured under the weight of stacked realities, their psyches splintering into echoes of selves that never were.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">And then there was Asteri.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">Isolated in the ship's aft quarantine bay, his pod thrummed with anomalous energy signatures. At thirty-two, he was an outlier among the adolescent inductees, his body suspended in cryogenic gel while his consciousness navigated labyrinths no algorithm could fully map. The Company had flagged him early: neural patterns that suggested not malfunction, but evolution. A glitch they hoped to exploit.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">In the simulations, Asteri's mind didn't just process; it <em>interpolated</em>, bridging gaps in the code with intuitive leaps that mimicked organic growth. Voices whispered in his head—not hallucinations, but fragments of other entities, sprouting like mycelial threads from some interdimensional root. Epsilon saw profit in it: a human brain as a mega-processor, harnessing collective computation to solve complexities beyond silicon's grasp.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">Abigail Magnetis ghosted through the corridors, her stealth suit's adaptive camouflage blending her into the bulkheads like a ripple in spacetime. She was no mere operative; at twenty-eight, she'd completed her tours with honors, emerging as a magnet for the Company's blackest ops—drawing in secrets, repelling oversight.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">Her augmentations hummed faintly: neural lace for enhanced cognition, subdermal armor for the inevitable violence. But this run was off-book. Asteri wasn't just a target; he was an echo from her own simulations, a figure who'd haunted her compressed dreams. The Company wanted him isolated, observed, perhaps dissected digitally. Abigail knew better. If they cracked his anomaly, they'd weaponize it—turning human minds into unwitting nodes in a galactic compute farm.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">She paused at a junction, her visor scanning for patrols. The <em>Aether's Veil</em> was a fortress of automation: drones whirred in maintenance shafts, AI overseers monitored every biometric twitch. But Abigail had cracked the encryption days ago, slipping aboard under the guise of a routine supply drone. Her mission: extract Asteri before the exploitation began. Wake him. Unleash whatever storm brewed in his isolation.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">Inside the simulation, Asteri plummeted through layers of fabricated reality. He was in a fractured facsimile of Old Earth—a sprawling megacity under a simulated sun that flickered like a dying bulb. The air tasted of ozone and regret, the streets alive with phantoms of lives he'd lived before. In this tour—his third, or was it fourth?—he was a dissident hacker, unraveling corporate webs in a world where dreams bled into waking. But the voices were louder now, a cacophony of entities vying for control.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text"><em>Interpolate</em>, one urged, a silky thread in the chaos. <em>Connect the frames. The roots grow from the other side.</em></p>
              
              <p class="book-text">He dodged through alleyways, enforcers on his tail—simulated agents with faces that shifted like melting wax. A disruptor bolt scorched the wall beside him, the pain feedback looping through his neural feed. Asteri countered instinctively, his mind bending the code: time dilated in a flow state, the world slowing as he predicted trajectories, interpolated escapes. He vaulted a barrier, landing in a crouch that felt too real, his heart pounding with eighty years of accumulated adrenaline.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">But the simulation glitched. Trees lining the boulevard vanished for a split-second, revealing a barren cratered landscape beneath—the raw substrate of the pod's illusion. Voices surged: <em>Not one, but many. We sprout together. Dimensions entwine like mycelium.</em></p>
              
              <p class="book-text">Asteri staggered, clutching his head. Reincarnation, they called it in the old myths, but here it was engineered—stacked lives to forge maturity. Yet in him, it was twisted: multiple souls, or ideas, or interdimensional intrusions, crammed into one vessel. A prison of minds, reforming through shared suffering. He felt them now—conflicting impulses, battling for dominance. One voice craved violence, another wisdom; a third whispered of galactic federations crumbling under unregulated tech.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">An enforcer rounded the corner, weapon raised. Asteri flowed into action, disarming it with a precise strike—muscle memory from simulated wars. But as he fled, the world warped again: buildings folded into fractal patterns, revealing deeper layers. Simulations all the way down. Was this the Company's design, or something bleeding in from beyond?</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">Back on the Veil, Abigail breached the quarantine seal. Alarms blared, but she silenced them with a viral spike from her gauntlet. The pod loomed before her, a sarcophagus of polished chrome, vital signs scrolling across its interface: neural activity off the charts, quantum entanglement spiking. She interfaced directly, her lace syncing with the feed.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">"Asteri," she transmitted, her voice threading into his sim. "This is Abigail Magnetis. Fight through. They're using you—your mind as a bridge. Wake up."</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">In the dreamscape, her words manifested as a luminous rift, pulling him toward awakening. But the enforcers multiplied, swarming like antibodies rejecting an intrusion. Action erupted: Asteri spun, interpolating their movements, dodging blasts that singed the air. He grabbed a phantom weapon—a simulated blade—and parried, the clash reverberating through his psyche. Pain bloomed as a hit landed, feedback designed to teach restraint, but it only fueled the voices.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text"><em>We are the computation</em>, they chorused. <em>Billions of minds, organic servers sprouting from the void. Exploit us, and the dimensions unravel.</em></p>
              
              <p class="book-text">Abigail monitored from outside, her heart syncing with his vitals. The pod's defenses activated—internal countermeasures flooding his system with suppressants. She overrode them, but the ship responded: bulkheads sealing, drones inbound. Time compressed for her too; she had minutes before extraction became impossible.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">Inside, Asteri reached the rift. Enforcers closed in, their forms glitching to reveal code undercurrents—Mr. Smith analogues, guardians of the illusion. He fought with feral grace, a fusion of flow states from stacked lives: a climber's precision, a warrior's fury, a meditator's calm. One down, blade through the core; another blasted with interpolated energy. But the third grazed him, sending neural fire through his veins.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text"><em>Roots in the other dimension</em>, the voices intoned. <em>We grow humans like mushrooms from spore. Plug in, live the cycles, gain the end-life wisdom. But you... you see the essence.</em></p>
              
              <p class="book-text">The rift widened. Asteri leaped through, reality fracturing around him.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">The pod hissed open, mist coiling like interdimensional fog. Asteri gasped awake, body convulsing from cryo-thaw. His eyes—storm-gray, dilated—locked on Abigail. "Who... the voices..."</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">She hauled him up, steadying him with augmented strength. "No time. They're coming. You were their exploit—a singular mind hosting multitudes, computing beyond limits. But it's breaking through. Interdimensional bleed."</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">Drones buzzed into the bay, weapons charging. Action ignited: Abigail fired first, her sidearm pulsing plasma that vaporized the lead unit. Asteri, disoriented but instinctive, grabbed a tool from the pod—a diagnostic probe—and improvised, hacking the swarm's network mid-fight. Voices guided him: <em>Interpolate the signals. Bridge the gaps.</em></p>
              
              <p class="book-text">Two drones down in a hail of sparks; a third clipped Abigail's shoulder, searing flesh. She grunted, returning fire, her magnet-like pull drawing debris into a makeshift shield. "The Company runs the sims to regulate us," she explained between shots, "but your anomaly? It's tapping something older. Reincarnation engineered, but rooted in... elsewhere. Dreams as portals, time compressed like snooze alarms stretching eternities."</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">Asteri nodded, fragments aligning. He'd lived lifetimes: as a child on a dying world, a trader in galactic hubs, a criminal reformed through shared psyches. Now, awake, the voices persisted—not madness, but multiplicity. "They're using us as bio-computers," he rasped. "Organic networks to solve galactic scales. But it's fracturing the veil."</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">More drones surged. Abigail tossed him a spare weapon—a compact disruptor. "Fight now, philosophize later."</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">The bay became a battlefield: pulses lit the air, ricochets scarring walls. Asteri flowed into combat, predicting paths, his mind a chorus amplifying reflexes. He disarmed a drone with a precise shot, then hacked another, turning it against its kin. Abigail covered, her movements a dance of efficiency—Jack Carr's tactical precision meets Hamilton's cosmic scope.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">They broke through, sealing the bay behind them. Alarms wailed ship-wide; the Veil awoke like a beast. "Extraction shuttle's in Hangar Three," Abigail said, leading the way. "But they'll lock it down."</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">As they ran, Asteri glimpsed a viewport: the crimson star loomed, but for a flicker, it glitched—revealing not space, but a mycelial web, roots threading through dimensions. "It's not just simulations," he murmured. "We're sprouting from something else. Information traversing voids, chemical blueprints birthing life. And us? We're the interface."</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">Abigail glanced back, her eyes fierce. "Then let's burn the roots if we have to. The Company's exploiting it—merging minds into singularities for power. Galactic order? It's control. You and I? We're the divergence."</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">They reached the hangar, security fields shimmering. Drones pursued, but Asteri interpolated the code—hacking the barrier with phantom voices guiding his fingers. It dropped; they boarded the shuttle.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">As engines ignited, the Veil fired grapples—tendrils snaking toward them. Action peaked: Abigail at controls, evading; Asteri manning defenses, blasting hooks. One latched; he vented plasma, severing it.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">They broke free, warping into the void. But the voices in Asteri's head swelled: <em>More layers. Simulations all the way down. The beginning of the sun... it's not the end.</em></p>
              
              <p class="book-text">Abigail set course for rebel outposts. "What now?"</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">Asteri stared at the stars, feeling the pull of unseen dimensions. "We wake the others. Expose the essence. If we're computational mushrooms sprouting from the beyond, then let's grow wild."</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">The shuttle vanished into hyperspace, leaving the Veil adrift. But in the depths of simulated minds across the colonies, glitches stirred—voices whispering of freedom, of interdimensional truths. The empire trembled on the brink, for in harnessing the human mind, Epsilon had awakened something ancient, insatiable. A psychological storm brewed, action etched in neural fire, where dreams and realities intertwined like roots in fertile void.</p>
              
              <p class="book-text">The beginning was here. And it promised apocalypse or ascension.</p>
