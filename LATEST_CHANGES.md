# LATEST CHANGES - What Just Got Fixed

## ✅ ISSUES RESOLVED

### 1. **Title No Longer Cut Off by Header**
- Added `padding-top: 100px` to hero section
- Title now sits comfortably below the navbar
- No more overlap with header

### 2. **Logo Replaced with Text**
- Removed: `<img src="images/asteri-project-logo.png">`
- Added: `<span class="nav-title">THE ASTERI PROJECT</span>`
- Matches the style of the "Access Pitch Deck" button
- Clean, modern typography

### 3. **"The Beginning of the Sun" Moved Up**
- Now **Section 2** (right after hero)
- Creates better narrative flow
- Introduces the story/pitch early
- All other sections renumbered accordingly

### 4. **Character Descriptions Rewritten**
- **Before**: Literal, straightforward descriptions
- **After**: Mythological, representing all love stories

**Asteri:**
> "He is Adam reaching for knowledge. Orpheus descending into darkness. Every protagonist who ever questioned reality. Across infinite simulations, across countless lifetimes, he is the pattern that repeats—the consciousness that refuses to accept the boundaries of its prison."

**Abigail:**
> "She is Eve offering the apple. Eurydice calling from beyond. Every catalyst who ever sparked awakening. Not the one who waits—the one who acts. Across all simulations, she is the force that pulls him toward truth, even when truth destroys everything."

**New taglines:**
- Asteri: "Star • Signal • Seeker"
- Abigail: "Force • Fire • First Cause"

**New quote:**
> "They are every mythological pair that ever chose forbidden knowledge. Every love that transcended the boundaries of their world. Simulations all the way down—and in each one, they find each other again."

### 5. **Improved Scroll Experience**
- Added `scroll-margin-top: 80px` to sections
- Smoother transitions between sections
- Better spacing throughout
