# HEADER & STORY FIXES - Ready for Git Push

## ✅ CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

### 1. **Header Overlap FIXED**
- Increased hero padding from `140px` to `180px`
- Title now sits well below navbar
- No more overlap with header
- **Ready for production**

### 2. **Header Buttons Matched**
**Before:**
```
THE ASTERI PROJECT (text)          [Access Pitch Deck]
```

**After:**
```
[THE ASTERI PROJECT]  [BOSun]     [Access Pitch Deck]
```

All three are now matching pill-shaped buttons:
- **THE ASTERI PROJECT** - Links to hero (#hero)
- **BOSun** - Links to story section (#story-intro) - secondary style
- **Access Pitch Deck** - Links to contact (#contact)

### 3. **Story Section Expanded**
**Before:** 3 short paragraphs + compliance line

**After:** 7 paragraphs with full narrative:
- ✅ System explanation (300 years, Epsilon)
- ✅ Training details (age 13, evaluations)
- ✅ Stakes (planets can be lost)
- ✅ **NEW:** Purpose explanation (preparation, not punishment)
- ✅ **NEW:** Asteri's discovery (inconsistencies, memories)
- ✅ **NEW:** The central question (how many times?)
- ✅ Compliance requirement (unavoidable)

## 📝 NEW STORY CONTENT

### Added Paragraphs:

**Paragraph 4:**
> "The simulations are not punishment. They are preparation. Each citizen emerges with the emotional maturity of someone who has lived multiple lifetimes—who has experienced love, loss, consequence, and the weight of choices that span decades. The recklessness of youth is replaced with the wisdom that only comes at the end of a long life."

**Paragraph 5:**
> "But Asteri begins to notice something. Small inconsistencies. Memories that don't align. Places that shouldn't exist. And a growing suspicion that the 'real world' he graduated into might itself be another layer of the simulation."

**Paragraph 6:**
> "How many times has he lived? How many times has he died? And if this reality is simulated—what lies beyond it?"

## 🎨 HEADER DESIGN

### Button Styles:
1. **Primary buttons** (THE ASTERI PROJECT, Access Pitch Deck)
   - Cyan border
   - Pill-shaped (border-radius: 100px)
   - Hover: fills with cyan, text turns black

2. **Secondary button** (BOSun)
   - Subtle white border (20% opacity)
   - Slightly darker background
   - Hover: cyan border, cyan glow

### Layout:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [THE ASTERI PROJECT]  [BOSun]     [Access Pitch Deck]  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
